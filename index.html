     <p>Wondering how no-code tools can help you grow as a freelancer? No-code tools are already disrupting software development the same way Fiverr has changed the gig economy, and Shopify has powered eCommerce building. </p>
     
     <p>No-code tools let you create software like mobile apps, websites, and more using visual methods like drag and drop builders. These tools have empowered the developer community to build and ship products faster than ever before â€“ the good news is that anyone, regardless of their training or ability to code, can build software using no-code! </p>
     <p>The no-code economy boom has come at a time when the world economy is recovering from one of the largest economic downturns in history, and no-code tools have made it possible for many gig economy workers and businesses to not only stay afloat during this unpredictable time, but to thrive.

     <b>No-code and the Gig Economy
    </b>
    <br>
    <p> The number of freelancers in the United States is projected to reach 100 million by 2027, and no-code will be a huge enabler for this trend. It has opened doors for people without technical expertise to try their hand at highly-technical work. Designers now have the opportunity to build products. Developers can cut down their timelines significantly because of how efficiently no-code tools can operate. </p>
